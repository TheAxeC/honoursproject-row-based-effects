Algebraic effects and handlers are a very active area of research. An important aspect is the development of an optimising compiler. Without a type-\&-effect system with explicit typing, it is easy for type checking bugs to be introduced during the construction of optimised compilation. A core language with row-based effects was introduced. The core language is explicitly typed in order to reduce bugs in the optimised compilation.
