The core language with row-based effects is based on the explicitly typed language used in Links \cite{row}. Links uses a row polymorphic type-\&-effect system . The design of their calculus is partially based on the type system used by Pretnar which makes it a suitable candidate for our core language \cite{pretnar2015introduction}. The terms of the core language are seen in Figure~\ref{fig:terms:explicit}, the types are seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:types:explicit}.
